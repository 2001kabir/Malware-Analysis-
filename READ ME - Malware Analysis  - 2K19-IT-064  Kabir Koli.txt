I am Kabir Koli 2K19/IT/064. I have done project on Malware detection using machine learning and deep learning. 
I have made 3 models - Random Forest, Logistic Regression and neural network.
Comparing the accuracy of all the model Random forest comes in 1st place, 
then neural network and then logistic regression mode. Reason could be that, 
logistic regression works better with balanced data set but our dataset was 
unbalanced and as far as neural network is concerned it works better with large data sets. 
So, Random forest is best model among these for datasets like these which is unbalanced.
